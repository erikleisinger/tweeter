# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. It demonstrates my ability to design a social media page (a la Twitter).

Both front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX) and back-end  (Node, Express, JSON) skills were required for this project to be user-friendly, visually dynamic, and responsive. 

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above
- body-parser

## Features:

### **Responsive Design**
 Tweeter's mostly-fluid visual design automatically scales to any size computer, tablet or smartphone screen.

### **Ease-of-Use**
 Tweeter is user-focused, and includes many features that make the user experience more convenient:

**"Back To Top" arrow** returns users to the top the page with the click of a button

**Finishing Touches**: Look around Tweeter for little bits of flare and pazaaz (notice the bouncing purple arrows?)
